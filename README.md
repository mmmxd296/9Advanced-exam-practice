## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Complete 265-Question Bank (Chronologically Ordered by Lesson)**:
   - **20 MCQ Tiles (Q1–Q20)**: Each tile contains **12 parameterized questions** (240 questions total).
   - **5 FRQ Tiles (Q21–Q25)**: Each tile contains **5 multi-part parameterized questions** (25 questions total).
   - **Lesson-by-Lesson Progression**: Questions are ordered strictly from Chapter 2 to Chapter 6 (Lesson 2-1 through Lesson 6-4).
   - **Dynamic Regeneration**: Clicking *"Retry with new numbers"* generates fresh random parameters following the exact textbook patterns.
   - **UAE & Universal Context**: Metric units exclusively ($\text{cm}, \text{m}, \text{km}, \text{g}, \text{kg}, \text{L}, ^\circ\text{C}$), AED currency, and everyday contexts.
2. **Instant Feedback, Self-Grading & Hints**:
   - Instant visual grading upon selection for MCQ.
   - **FRQ Self-Assessment**: The answer and full model solution start hidden behind an *"👁️ Show Answer & Model Solution"* button. Once revealed, students compare their solution and select either the **Green button** (*"✓ I solved it correctly"*, +1.0 pt) or the **Red button** (*"✗ I got it wrong"*, 0.0 pts) to record their score out of 5 and unlock navigation.
   - 3 progressive hints per question. **Hint 3 shows a fully worked similar example with different numbers** (never reveals the current question's answer).
   - Detailed mathematical explanations rendered with KaTeX.
   - Plausible MCQ distractors with detailed *"Why this is wrong"* notes.
3. **Interactive Mathematics Tools**:
   - Built-in floating **Scientific Calculator** available on every practice screen.
   - Dynamic **Number Line Visualizer** for compound inequalities with open/closed circles and interval shading.
   - Dynamic **Cartesian Coordinate Grid** with $x$- and $y$-intercepts and plotted linear functions.
4. **Lesson Mastery & Printable Certificates**:
   - Questions grouped into curriculum lessons (e.g. Lesson 5-2, Lesson 2-4, Lesson 6-3, etc.).
   - Master a lesson by achieving $> 80\%$ score across its sets.
   - Celebratory confetti and elegant **A4 Landscape Certificate of Mastery** featuring official school wordmarks and mathematics exam branding.
   - Certificate export options: **Download PDF**, **Download PNG**, and **Print**.
5. **Session-Only Student State**:
   - Student enters their name once per session (Arabic and English supported).
   - Progress and scores are stored in `sessionStorage` (no logins, accounts, or backend required).
   - *"Change student"* link resets the session cleanly.
